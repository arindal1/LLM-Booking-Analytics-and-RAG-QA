# LLM-Powered Booking Analytics & QA System

This project provides a comprehensive solution for processing hotel booking data, extracting business insights, and enabling retrieval-augmented question answering (RAG) through an LLM-powered API. The system combines data analytics, vector-based retrieval with FAISS, and a lightweight language model to answer questions about hotel bookings.

## Overview

The project is designed to:

- **Process hotel booking records**: Clean and preprocess raw data.
- **Extract analytics**: Generate insights such as revenue trends, cancellation rates, geographical distribution of bookings, and booking lead time.
- **Answer questions**: Use vector-based retrieval and a pre-trained language model (DistilGPT2) to answer queries regarding booking data.
- **Expose functionality via REST API**: FastAPI endpoints provide access to analytics, Q&A, and system health checks.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-booking-analytics.git
   cd llm-booking-analytics
   ```

2. **Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:**

   ```bash

## Data Collection & Preprocessing

- **Dataset**: A sample hotel bookings dataset (CSV) is used. You may also use other relevant datasets as long as they contain required fields.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Handle missing values and format inconsistencies.
  - Convert date fields (e.g., `arrival_date`) into datetime objects.
  - Use appropriate data types for numerical fields (e.g., `int8`, `float32`).
- **Storage**: Preprocessed data is saved as `hotel_bookings_preprocessed.csv` and loaded in the application for analytics and QA.

<details>
  <summary>More on Data Cleaning</summary>

  - **Missing Values**: Checked and handled during preprocessing.
  - **Data Types**: Fields such as `is_canceled`, `lead_time`, `adr`, etc., are cast to optimal types for performance.
  - **Aggregation**: Data is grouped (e.g., by month) to compute analytics like revenue trends.
</details>

---

## Analytics & Reporting

The system computes various analytics from the preprocessed data:

- **Revenue Trends**: Aggregated monthly revenue calculated using the arrival date.
- **Cancellation Rate**: Percentage of total bookings that were canceled.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Top 5 countries based on the number of bookings.
- **Booking Lead Time Distribution**: Insights into the lead times for bookings.
- **Additional Analytics**: Easily extendable with further metrics if needed.

Analytics are computed using libraries such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), in [bookinganalytics.pdf](notes/bookinganalytics.pdf).

---

## Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering (RAG)

The RAG system integrates several components:

- **Embeddings**:
  - Uses [SentenceTransformer](https://www.sbert.net/) (`paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to compute vector embeddings for each booking record.
  - These embeddings are stored in a FAISS index (`faiss_index.bin` and `embeddings.npy`).

- **Question Answering**:
  - For a given user question, the system computes its embedding and retrieves the top *k* similar booking records.
  - The retrieved records form the context for the LLM prompt.
  - Uses [DistilGPT2](https://huggingface.co/distilgpt2) to generate an answer based on the context.

<details>
  <summary>How It Works</summary>

  1. **Embedding Calculation**: Each booking record is converted to a text string and embedded.
  2. **Vector Store**: FAISS is used to quickly search and retrieve similar records.
  3. **Prompt Formation**: Retrieved records are concatenated to form a context prompt.
  4. **LLM Inference**: The language model generates a response based on the provided prompt.
</details>

## API Endpoints

The project exposes three main REST API endpoints:

### POST `/analytics`

- **Description**: Returns the computed analytics including cancellation rate, revenue trends, and top booking countries.

      "question": "What is the average revenue per booking in July 2017?",
      "answer": "Based on the retrieved records, the average revenue per booking in July 2017 was approximately $XXX.XX."
  }
  ```

### GET `/health`

- **Description**: Health check endpoint that returns the status of the system along with details like the FAISS index size and model status.

## Performance Evaluation

- **Accuracy**: The accuracy of Q&A responses can be evaluated by comparing generated answers with expected outcomes for a set of test queries.
- **Response Time**: Middleware in `app.py` logs the processing time for each API request.
- **Optimization**: Ensure that the FAISS index is pre-built and stored to speed up retrieval. Use batching and efficient preprocessing where applicable.

<details>
  <summary>Evaluation Metrics</summary>

  - **API Response Time**: Measured via the `X-Process-Time` header.
  - **Retrieval Speed**: Number of vectors in the FAISS index indicates scalability.
  - **LLM Response Quality**: Validate through sample queries and user feedback.
</details>

---

## Deployment

To deploy the system:

1. **Local Deployment**: Run the FastAPI app locally using Uvicorn.
2. **Production Deployment**: Consider deploying with a production-ready ASGI server (e.g., Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers) behind a reverse proxy.
3. **Containerization**: Package the solution with Docker for ease of deployment.


---

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Data Updates**: Integrate with a database (SQLite, PostgreSQL) to update analytics as new data arrives.
- **Query History Tracking**: Implement a logging mechanism to track user queries.
- **Additional Endpoints**: For example, a dedicated endpoint for retrieving historical query logs.
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Add more metrics and visualizations based on user needs.

<details>
  <summary>Bonus Features</summary>

  - **Health Check Enhancements**: Extend the `/health` endpoint to verify connectivity with external services.
  - **User Authentication**: Secure API endpoints with authentication and authorization.
</details>

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Preprocessed Data Not Found**:  
  Ensure that `hotel_bookings_preprocessed.csv` is generated and placed in the project root before starting the server.

- **Dependency Issues**:  
  Verify that all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` are installed in your virtual environment.

- **Performance Bottlenecks**:  
  For large datasets, consider increasing the chunk size when reading CSVs and optimizing the FAISS index building process.

<details>
  <summary>Common Issues</summary>

  - **FAISS Index Not Loading**: Check that `faiss_index.bin` and `embeddings.npy` exist. If not, the application will automatically compute and save these.
  - **LLM Response Latency**: Fine-tune LLM generation parameters (e.g., `max_length`, `temperature`) if responses are slow.
